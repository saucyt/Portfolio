    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I am a new software developer who has goals and ambitions to create software that could leave an impact. Ever since I was a child I always have had an interest in computers and how they operate. I used to spend hours in the family room taking apart and putting back together our old gateway tower, hoping to learn something new about how the computer operated. Now as a developer, I get to create software for computers like the ones I use to dismantle.</p>
    <p>Outside of my interest in web development I have a deep love for photography, competitive video games, and cars. Two of my favorite intrest of mines is driving my car down backroads and taking pictures using film. So, if youre looking for a new software developer or want to talk for hours about cars, feel free to reach out and contact me. </p>
